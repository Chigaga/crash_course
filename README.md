# OpenAstronomy Crash Course

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/openastronomy/crash_course)

This short (3-5 hours) lecture serves as a broad introduction to Python for solar physics.
The first section covers basic Python syntax and usage, with a focus on NumPy and arrays.
The second introduces SunPy and discusses plotting both in general and for solar data with SunPy Maps.
In the final session, students will learn some more advanced features of SunPy for finding and downloading data and for transforming between coordinate systems.
Previous experience with another language is assumed, and basic programming concepts are not covered.
Learners need not have any prior knowledge of Python or Python packages, though.

Pull requests to improve this content or to add other short lessons are welcome.
